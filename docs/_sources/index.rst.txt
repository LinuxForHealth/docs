What is iDAAS?
**************

Healthcare integration has been a challenge for decades. iDAAS is the Intelligent Data As A Service platform, designed to integrate any healthcare data, in any format, and provide new insights on that data.  In addition to comprehensive transformation and insights, iDAAS enables downstream services to securely receive and operate on healthcare data, effectively bridging the disparate systems that comprise the healthcare industry.

iDAAS is built on:

* Apache Camel for integration, supported by one of the most active development communities.

* Kafka and NATS for world-class data streaming and messaging.

* Standard data formats, including HL7 FHIR R4, HL7 MLLP and EDI, with easy extensiblity to support any format.
